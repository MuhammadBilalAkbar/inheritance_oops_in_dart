**Great Features**

1. Inheritance is very important concept in every programming language. It makes code easy for
   developers.
2. Three types of inheritance:
    - Single level inheritance
    - Multilevel inheritance
    - Hierarchical inheritance
3. So, this concept is very useful.

**Problems from Videos**

- Question: Does dart allow multiple inheritance like in c++ where a child has more than one parent
  class?
  <br/> Answer: Nope, Dart Just Support Multilevel Inheritance.

## 3. Video Structure

**Main Points / Purpose Of Lesson**

**The Structured Main Content**

#### What is inheritance?

The process in which one class derives the properties and characteristics of another class. The
process of deriving the properties and characteristics of another class. It is sharing of behaviour
between two classes.

#### What is class?

- Class is a blueprint.
- Object is instance of class.
- Properties of class are instance or field variables.
- Constructor of class is method. Its name is same as class name and it is default constructor.
  When object is created, constructor is called automatically.
- If a sub class is extending from super class then default constructor of base-class or
  super-class or parent-class is also
  called in constructor of sub-class or child-class automatically.

#### What is Extend keyword?

- Extend mean to inherit all the properties of another class. Extending mean inheriting.
- Word `super` comes from the super class. `this` keyword is for
  current class.
  `super` keyword is for the super-class. The super class can be accessed by using the super
  keyword.
- Inheritance concept is achieved by using the `Extends` keyword. Extend is used for sharing methods
  and properties between super-class and sub-class.
  <br/>All fields and methods inside the super-class are available in the sub-class.
- Everything you create will be an object instantiated from a class.
  Every class you create will extend/inherit from by default the object class.
  Like `Class className extends Object`.
- All dart classes extend only one class (object class by default) but in hierarchical way, a class
  can access fields and methods of more than one class.

#### Types of Inheritance

There are three types of inheritance in dart.

- Single level inheritance in `single_inheritance.dart` file.
- Multi level inheritance in `multi_level_inheritance.dart` file.
- Hierarchical inheritance in `hierarchical_inheritance.dart` file.
- `inheritance_real_world_example1.dart` file is real world example of Animals.
- `inheritance_real_world_example2.dart` file explains the overriding of methods.
